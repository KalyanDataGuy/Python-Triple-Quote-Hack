# Python-Triple-Quote-Hack
Part 2 of Data Analytics Cheatsheets - Geek Edition

Stop old Python code from running — run only your new snippet.

### Quick Concept:
- Triple quotes (`'''`) comment out entire blocks
- Perfect for debugging and testing new code
- Works in notebooks and scripts

### Example:
```python
'''
df = load_data()
cleaned = clean(df)
print(cleaned)
'''
print("Run only this!")
Output: Run only this!
