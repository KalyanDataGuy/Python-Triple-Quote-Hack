# 🐍 Python Triple-Quote Hack — KalyanDataGuy Cheatsheet Geek Edition

**by KalyanDataGuy**

Ever wished you could **pause old Python code** without deleting it?  
The **triple-quote hack (`'''`)** lets you wrap entire blocks of code, silence them, and test only what matters.  
Old logic stays safe, new snippets run freely.  

---

## 🔍 Why This Hack Exists

Python developers, learners, and data analysts often **re-run entire notebooks by accident**, slowing down experimentation.  
This hack **prevents unnecessary executions**, making debugging and iterative testing smooth.  

---

## ⚡ The Hack — Step by Step

1. Wrap old code blocks in **triple single quotes (`'''`)**:

```python
'''
df = load_data()
cleaned = clean(df)
print(cleaned)
'''

---
Write and run your new snippet outside the quotes:
print("Run only this!")

✅ Geek Tip: Triple quotes also work for temporary notes, pseudo-docstrings, or reminders.
No deletion required — experiment safely, step by step.

🐍 Hack Table — Quick Reference
| Problem             | Default Behavior    | Hack Outcome                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Running old code    | Executes everything | Triple-quote blocks ignore old code |
| Debugging           | Slow, error-prone   | Focus only on new snippets          |
| Workflow efficiency | Repeated edits      | Safe, isolated testing              |


Cheat Insight: Like a neon debug light in your code 🌃, triple quotes let your experiments run safely while keeping history intact.
